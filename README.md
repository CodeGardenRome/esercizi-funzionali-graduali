# Incremental katas solved using many different programming languages

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CodeGardenRome/incremental-katas-jvm-langs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CodeGardenRome/incremental-katas-jvm-langs)

This project contains a set of solutions to [incremental katas](https://github.com/Gianfrancoalongi/incremental_katas) by using different programming languages.

The goal is to show how to apply functional programming principles in all environments to exercises that gradually increment in complexity.

We also want to compare the solutions with equivalent traditional imperative ones. 

To build the project, use the `gradlew` executable
