# Incremental katas solved using Scala

This project contains a set of solutions to [incremental katas](https://github.com/Gianfrancoalongi/incremental_katas) by using the Scala language.

To build the project, download the [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) tool and run it in the project root.

You usually install directly the tool from your OS using `apt` or `homebrew`, too. Instructions should be on the _sbt_ website.
